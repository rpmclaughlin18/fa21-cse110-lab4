1) values added: 20
2) final result: 20
3) values added: 20
4) This throws an error since we try and log result on line 13 but result only exists within the scope of the if statement because we used the keyword let to declare it in block scope.
5) This throws an error since you are trying to assign a value to a const variable on line 7.
6) Same as 5
